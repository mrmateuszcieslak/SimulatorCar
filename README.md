SimulatorCar – Interactive Car Navigation & Street Management System

SimulatorCar is a desktop simulation application developed in C# with Windows Forms, designed to provide an interactive experience for car navigation and street management. The project showcases advanced object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and database integration via ADO.NET.
Technology Stack:

    Programming Language: C#
    Framework: Windows Forms
    Database: Microsoft SQL Server (MS SQL Server Management Studio 18.10)
    Development Environment: Visual Studio 2019 Community
    Data Management: ADO.NET with DataSet model

Key Features:

✅ Car Navigation: Control the car using arrow keys for a dynamic driving experience.

✅ Street Database Management: Press F5 to access and edit street information, including names, locations, and parameters.

✅ Data Persistence: Easily modify or add new streets and save changes with a dedicated "SaveChanges" button.

✅ Real-time Updates: Integrated ADO.NET communication ensures smooth interaction between the application and the database.
Why This Project Stands Out?

    Demonstrates proficiency in Windows Forms and database-driven applications.
    Applies best practices in OOP and ADO.NET-based data handling.
    Highlights the ability to develop interactive simulations with user-controlled elements.
