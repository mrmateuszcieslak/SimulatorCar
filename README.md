# 🚗 SimulatorCar – Interactive Car Navigation & Street Management System  

**SimulatorCar** is a **desktop simulation application** developed in **C# with Windows Forms**, designed to offer an interactive experience for **car navigation and street management**. The project demonstrates **advanced object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts** and **database integration** using **ADO.NET**, making it an excellent example of a data-driven application.  

## 🛠️ Technology Stack  

- **Programming Language:** C#  
- **Framework:** Windows Forms  
- **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server (MS SQL Server Management Studio 18.10)  
- **Development Environment:** Visual Studio 2019 Community  
- **Data Management:** ADO.NET with the DataSet model  

## 🚀 Key Features  

✅ **Dynamic Car Navigation** – Control the car using **arrow keys** for an engaging driving experience.  

✅ **Street Database Management** – Press **F5** to open and modify street details such as names, locations, and additional parameters.  

✅ **Data Persistence** – Modify or add new streets effortlessly and save changes with the **"SaveChanges"** button.  

✅ **Real-time Updates** – The system ensures smooth communication between the **application and the database** through **ADO.NET integration**.  

## 🎯 Why This Project Stands Out?  

- 📌 Showcases expertise in **Windows Forms** and **database-driven application development**.  
- 📌 Implements **OOP best practices** combined with **ADO.NET-based data handling**.  
- 📌 Demonstrates the ability to develop **interactive simulations with real-time user input**.
